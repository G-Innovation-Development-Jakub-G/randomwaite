# randomwaite

Randomwaite is a [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/autotarot) that uses the Flickr API and PIL to randomly generate Tarot cards. Each tarot card is associated with a set of keywords which is used to find (hopefully) relevant images. Then, a set of glitchy transformations is applied for each card, taking into account the meaning of the card and how it was drawn.

You can check out a presentation of this tool at PyDX 2016 on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMj_wXRMbgQ).
